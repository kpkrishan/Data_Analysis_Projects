# Bay Wheels Dataset
In this project I will be doing data analysis of Bay Wheels's trip dataset of the year 2017. Bay
Wheel's Dataset cover the three major regions San Francisco,San Jose and East Bay where the
trips begin and end as well(It can be intra or inter region trips).

The dataset consists of bike rides from FY2017. The attributes include the trip start/end time,
start/end station, duration in seconds as well as additional information such as user type.
The main purpose of doing analysis is to find out the trends and some useful information. On the
basis of those trends we can get business insights visually. To do data analysis I will follow the ideal way of data preprocessing, data visualization and the
documentation. 

The documentation will include:

1.Exploratory Data Analysis

2.Explanatory Data Analysis
